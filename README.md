# Snake Game in Java

Welcome to my Java Snake Game project! This is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game, written in Java using the Swing library for the graphical interface.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Compile and run:**

3. **Controls:**
- Use arrow keys to control the snake (up, down, left, right).
- The goal is to eat the food (represented by a dot) to increase the snake's length.
- The game ends if the snake hits the screen border or bites itself.

## Requirements

- Java SDK installed (recommended version: Java 8 or higher).
